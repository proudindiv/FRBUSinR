This paper provides documentation for a large-scale estimated DSGE model
 of the U.S. economy - the Federal Reserve Board's Estimated, Dynamic, 
Optimization-based (FRB/EDO) model project. The model can be used to 
address a wide range of practical policy questions on a routine basis. 
The paper
discusses the model's specification, estimated parameters, and key 
properties. <!-- #/abstract# --></div>

<p><br>
This paper contains documentation for the large-scale estimated DSGE 
model of the U.S. economy currently used at the Federal Reserve Board 
for some forecasting and policy projects - the Estimated, Dynamic, 
Optimization-based (EDO) model. Section&nbsp;1 provides a brief 
qualitative description of
the model and outlines its main features for production, capital 
evolution, and preference technologies. Section&nbsp;2 defines the 
equilibrium of the model. Section&nbsp;3 lists the data that is used in 
estimating the model. Section&nbsp;4 reports the model's key estimation 
results, which include
the estimated parameter values, variance decompositions, impulse 
response functions, and estimated paths of the exogenous processes 
driving the model. The equations that characterize equilibrium in this 
model are contained in the appendix. Appendix&nbsp;A reports the 
equations of the symmetric and
stationary model, and appendix&nbsp;B gives the solution to the model's 
steady-state. Finally, since the model contains a large number of 
parameter and variable names a key is given in appendices&nbsp;C, D, 
and&nbsp;E.</p>
<p>Before moving to our presentation of the model, we note that the EDO 
model serves as a complement to the analyses that are currently 
performed using existing large-scale econometric models, such as FRB/US 
model, as well as smaller, <em>ad hoc</em> models that we have found
useful for more specific questions. In our experience, model-based 
analyses are enhanced by consideration of multiple models (and, indeed, 
our experience suggests that often we learn as much when models disagree
 than when they agree). A benefit of having multiple models is the 
opportunity to
examine the robustness of policy strategies across models with quite 
different foundations, which we view as important given the significant 
divergences of opinion regarding the plausibility of various types of 
models.</p>
<p>In addition, the EDO model is designed to allow the straightforward 
consideration of factors not explicitly modeled in the baseline version 
of the model. For example, the baseline version assumes that investment 
decisions - of households and firms - are made by capital 
intermediaries; simple
modifications of this intermediation step allow explicit consideration 
of the financial accelerator or financial intermediation (e.g., a 
banking sector), topics of ongoing research.</p>
<p>These advantages of the model have been demonstrated in previous 
research on its forecast performance (Edge, Kiley, and Laforte (2010)), 
its application to policy questions such as the natural rate (Edge, 
Kiley, and Laforte (2008)), and the analysis of the cyclical state of 
the economy (Kiley
(2010b)).</p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000" id="SECTION00010000000000000000"><span class="arabic">1</span> Model Overview and Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Figure <a href="#FigSmets">1</a> provides a graphical overview of the model.</p>
<p>The model possesses two final good sectors in order to capture key 
long-run growth facts and to differentiate between the cyclical 
properties of different categories of durable expenditure (e.g., 
housing, consumer durables, and nonresidential investment). For example,
 technological progress has
been faster in the production of business capital and consumer durables 
(such as computers and electronics). Edge, Kiley, and Laforte (2008 and 
2010) discuss this motivation in greater detail. The first sector is the
 slow-growing sector--called "CBI" because <em>most</em> of
these goods are used for consumption (C) and because they are produced 
by the business and institutions (BI) sector--and the second is the 
fast-growing sector--called "KB" because these goods are used for 
capital (K) accumulation and are produced by the business (B) sector. 
The goods are produced
in two stages by intermediate- and then final-goods producing firms 
(shown in the center of the figure). As in most new-Keynesian models, 
the introduction of intermediate and final goods producers facilitates 
the specification of nominal rigidities.</p>
<p>The disaggregation of production (aggregate supply) leads naturally 
to some disaggregation of expenditures (aggregate demand). We move 
beyond the typical model with just two categories of (private domestic) 
demand (consumption and investment) and distinguish between four 
categories of private
demand: consumer non-durable goods and non-housing services, consumer 
durable goods, residential investment, and non-residential investment. 
The boxes surrounding the producers in the figure illustrate how we 
structure the sources of each demand category. Consumer non-durable 
goods and services are
sold directly to households; consumer durable goods, residential capital
 goods, and non-residential capital goods are intermediated through 
capital-goods intermediaries (owned by the households), who then rent 
these capital stocks to households. Consumer non-durable goods and 
services and
residential capital goods are purchased (by households and residential 
capital goods owners, respectively) from the first of economy's two 
final goods producing sectors, while consumer durable goods and 
non-residential capital goods are purchased (by consumer durable and 
residential capital goods
owners, respectively) from the second sector. In addition to consuming 
the non-durable goods and services that they purchase, households supply
 labor to the intermediate goods-producing firms in both sectors of the 
economy.</p>
<p>This remainder of this section provides an overview of the decisions 
made by each of the agents in our economy. Given some of the broad 
similarities between our model and others, our presentation is 
selective.</p>

<p>The final group of private agents in the model are households who 
make both expenditure and labor-supply decisions. Households derive 
utility from four sources: their purchases of the consumer non-durable 
goods and non-housing services, the flow of services from their rental 
of consumer-durable
capital, the flow of services from their rental of residential capital, 
and their leisure time, which is equal to what remains of their time 
endowment after labor is supplied to the market. Preferences are 
separable over all arguments of the utility function. The utility that 
households derive from
the three components of goods and services consumption is influenced by 
the habit stock for each of these consumption components, a feature that
 has been shown to be important for consumption dynamics in similar 
models. A household's habit stock for its consumption of non-durable 
goods and
non-housing services is equal to a factor <span class="MATH"><img src="FRB:%20Finance%20and%20Economics%20Discussion%20Series:%20Screen%20Reader%20Version%20-%20Documentation%20of%20the%20Estimated,%20Dynamic,%20Optimization-based%20%28EDO%29%20Model%20of%20the%20U.S.%C2%A0Economy:%202010%20Version_files/img88.gif" alt=" h" height="15" width="14" align="bottom" border="0"></span> multiplied by its consumption last period <!-- MATH

<p>Our brief presentation of the model highlights several important 
points. First, although our model considers production and expenditure 
decisions in a bit more detail, it shares many similar features with 
other DSGE models in the literature, such as imperfect competition, 
nominal price and wage
rigidities, and real frictions like adjustment costs and 
habit-persistence. The rich specification of structural shocks (to 
aggregate and investment-specific productivity, aggregate and 
sector-specific risk premiums, and mark-ups) and adjustment costs allows
 our model to be brought to the data with
some chance of finding empirical validation.</p>
<p>Within EDO, fluctuations in all economic variables are driven by 
eleven structural shocks. It is most convenient to summarize these 
shocks into four broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent technology shocks: This category consists of shocks to 
aggregate and investment-specific (or fast-growing sector) technology.</li>
<li>Financial, or intertemporal, shocks: This category consists of 
shocks to risk premia. In EDO, variation in risk premia - both the 
premium households' receive relative to the federal funds rate on 
nominal bond holdings and the additional variation in discount rates 
applied to the investment
decisions of capital intermediaries - are purely exogenous. Nonetheless,
 the specification captures important aspects of related models with 
more explicit financial sectors (e.g., Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist 
(1999)), as we discuss in our presentation of the model's properties 
below.</li>
<li>Markup shocks: This category includes the price and wage markup shocks.</li>
<li>Other demand shocks: This category includes the shock to autonomous demand and a monetary policy shock.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of market clearing conditions that must be 
satisfied in our model. Market clearing in the slow-growing 
"consumption" goods and fast-growing "capital" goods sectors, given 
price- and wage-adjustment costs and variable utilization costs, implies
 that</p>

<p>The empirical implementation of the model takes a log-linear 
approximation to the first-order conditions and constraints that 
describe the economy's equilibrium, casts this resulting system in its 
state-space representation for the set of (in our case 11) observable 
variables, uses the Kalman
filter to evaluate the likelihood of the observed variables, and forms 
the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest by combining 
the likelihood function with a joint density characterizing some prior 
beliefs. Since we do not have a closed-form solution of the posterior, 
we rely on
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.</p>
<p>The model is estimated using 11 data series over the sample period from 1984:Q4 to 2008:Q4. The series are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The growth rate of real gross domestic product;</li>
<li>The growth rate of real consumption expenditure on non-durables and services excluding housing services;</li>
<li>The growth rate of real consumption expenditure on durables;</li>
<li>The growth rate of real residential investment expenditure;</li>
<li>The growth rate of real business investment expenditure;</li>
<li>Consumer price inflation, as measured by the growth rate of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index;</li>
<li>Consumer price inflation, as measured by the growth rate of the PCE price index excluding food and energy prices;</li>
<li>Inflation for consumer durable goods, as measured by the growth rate of the PCE price index for durable goods;</li>

<li>The federal funds rate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The model' calibrated parameters are presented in Table <a href="#CalPar">1</a>, while the estimated parameters are presented in Tables <a href="#EstParI">3</a> and <a href="#EstParII">4</a>.
 We based out decision on several considerations. First, some important 
determinants of steady-state
behavior were calibrated to yields growth rates of GDP and associated 
price indexes that corresponded to "conventional" wisdom in policy 
circles, even though slight deviations from such values would have been 
preferred (in a "statistically significant" way) to our calibrated 
values. In other
cases, parameters were calibrated based on how informative the data were
 likely to be on the parameter and/or identification and 
overparameterization issues. Finally, the standard deviations of the 
measurement error assumed in the observables was chosen to ensure a 
moderate contribution of such
errors to the variability in the data (according to our model) while 
also preserving desirable forecast properties; we present the 
observables and the role of measurment error in the results below.</p>
<p>The first three columns of Table <a href="#EstParI">3</a> and <a href="#EstParII">4</a>
 outline our assumptions about the prior distributions of the estimated 
parameters, the remaining columns describe the parameters' posterior 
distributions, which we now proceed to discuss.</p>
<p>We consider first the parameters related to household and business 
spending decisions. The habit-persistence parameter is moderate, near 
0.6.<a name="footnote_reference_2" href="#footnote_1419" title="Footnote 2" id="footnote_reference_2"><sup><span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>Investment
adjustment
 costs are large for residential investment but small for business 
investment. This finding highlights once advantage of our disaggregated 
approach. In addition, this result is importantly driven by the 
inclusion of inventory investment in business investment; this is a very
 cyclically
important component of GDP and was an important element in early 
investigations of dynamic general equilbrium models (e.g., Kydland and 
Prescott (1982)), but is typically ignored in similar DSGE models.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the inverse of the labor supply elasticity 
implies quite elastic labor supply. We also find a role for the sectoral
 adjustment costs to labor: In our multisector setup, shocks to 
productivity or preferences in one sector of the economy result in 
strong shifts of labor
towards that sector, which conflicts with the high degree of sectoral 
co-movement in the data.</p>
<p>Finally, adjustment costs to prices and wages are both estimated to 
be important. Our estimate of the price adjustment cost is equivalent to
 a Calvo pricing setting where a bit more than half of the firms cannot 
update their prices each period. The estimated quadratic costs in wages 
imply a
slightly larger frequency of adjustments for the suppliers of labor. We 
also find only a modest role for lagged inflation in our adjustment cost
 specification (around 1/4), equivalent to modest indexation to lagged 
inflation in other sticky-price specifications. This differs from some 
other
estimates, perhaps because of the focus on a more recent post-1983 
sample (similar to results in [<a href="#KileyInflation">Kiley (2007)</a>] and [<a href="#LaforteInflation">Laforte (2007)</a>]).</p>

<p>Tables <a href="#VarDecomp0a">5</a> and <a href="#VarDecompIIb">6</a>
 present forecast error variance decompositions at various (quarterly) 
horizons at the posterior mode of the parameter estimates for key 
variables and shocks. We run through the key results here.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility in aggregate GDP growth</strong> is accounted for 
primarily by the technology shocks in each sector, although the 
economy-wide risk premium shock contributes non-negligibly to the 
unconditional variance of GDP growth.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility in hours per capita</strong> is accounted for 
primarily by the economy-wide risk premium and business investment risk 
premium shocks at horizons between one and sixteen quarters. Technology 
shocks in each sector contribute appreciably to the unconditional 
variance.
The large role for risk premia shocks in the forecast error 
decomposition at business cycle horizons illustrates the importance of 
this type of "demand" shock for volatility in the labor market. This 
result is notable, as hours per capita is the series most like a "gap" 
variable in the model -
that is, house per capita shows persistent cyclical fluctuations about 
its trend value.</p>

<p>We now turn to the impulse responses of some of the key observable 
variables to the exogenous shocks that drive fluctuations in the model. 
In each case we consider unit shocks; the reader is referred to the 
reported estimates of the standard deviation of the shocks for 
information that will
scale these responses to units consistent with a standard deviation 
shock. Expenditure variables are reported as percent deviations from 
initial values (in natural log points); inflation variables and the 
federal funds rate are reported at quarterly (not annual) rates.</p>
<p>The impulse responses to a monetary policy innovation (shown in figure <a href="#eR">5</a>)
 captures the conventional wisdom regarding the effects of such shocks. 
In particular, both household and business expenditures on durables 
(consumer durables, residential investment, and nonresidential
investment) respond strongly (and with a hump-shape) to a contractionary
 policy shock, with more muted responses by nondurables and services 
consumption; each measure of inflation responds gradually, albeit more 
quickly than in some analyses based on vector autoregressions (VARs). 
(This difference
between VAR-based and DSGE-model based impulse responses has been 
highlighted elsewhere - for example, in the survey of Boivin, Kiley, and
 Mishkin (2010)).</p>

<p>The aggregate risk premium shock (figure <a href="#eB">2</a>) 
depresses spending across the board, lowering hours appreciably; 
inflation and the federal funds rate fall in response. (As in the model 
of Smets and Wouters (2007), the aggregate risk premium drives down the 
flexible-price nominal
interest rate one-for-one, and hence the downward move in the nominal 
funds rate facilitates moving the economy toward its flexible price 
outcome).</p>
<p>Shocks to sectoral risk premia (figures <a href="#eEFFECH">10</a>, <a href="#eEFFECD">11</a> and <a href="#eEFFK">12</a>)
 principally depress spending in the associated category of expenditure,
 with offsetting positive effects on other spending (which is "crowded 
in").</p>
<p>The impulse responses to a capital-specific technology shock (shown in figure <a href="#eMUZK">6</a>)
 are a touch more gradual, as the embodied component of this type of 
technological progress implies a need for nonresidential capital 
accumulation. (In addition, the long-run responses of
nonresidential investment and consumer durables are much larger than 
those of other spending, reflecting the biased nature of this technology
 shock).</p>
<p>Following an economy-wide technology shock (figure <a href="#eMUZM">7</a>),
 output rises gradually to its long-run level; hours respond relatively 
little to the shock (in comparison to, for example, output, reflecting 
both the influence of stick prices and wages and the offsetting income 
and
substitution effects of such a shock on households willingness to supply
 labor.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#EDO_ME">13</a> presents the observed data (in blue) 
and the observable data net of the model's estimated measurement error 
(in black), along 95 percent confidence intervals. For series other than
 overall PCE price inflation, measurement error is a moderate portion of
 movements
in the series. The larger role for measurement error in accounting for 
the path of PCE price inflation reflects the absence of separate sectors
 for food and energy in the model.</p>
<p>Figures <a href="#EDO_SHOCK">14</a> and <a href="#EDO_EXOG">15</a> 
report modal estimates of the model's structural shocks and the 
persistent exogenous drivers (i.e., risk premia and autonomous demand). 
These series have recognizable patterns for those familiar with U.S. 
economic fluctuations.
For example, the risk premia jump at the end of the sample, reflecting 
the financial crisis and the model's identification of risk premia, both
 economy-wide and for housing, as key drivers. In addition, the large 
negative value for autonomous demand around 2005 reflects the widening 
of the current
account deficit: While this factor is absent from our closed-economy 
model, the use of economywide data picks up the drag from demand other 
than demand for U.S. produced goods and services.<a name="footnote_reference_3" href="#footnote_1463" title="Footnote 3" id="footnote_reference_3"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, these stories from a glance at the exogenous drivers yield
 applications for alternative versions of the EDO model and future model
 enhancements. For example, the exogenous risk premia can easily be made
 to have an endogenous component following the approach of Bernanke, 
Gertler, and
Gilchrist (1999) (and indeed we have considered models of that type). At
 this point we view incorporation of such mechanisms in our baseline 
approach as premature, pending ongoing research on financial frictions, 
banking, and intermediation in dynamic general equilibrium models. 
Nonetheless, the
EDO model captured the key financial disturbances during the last 
several years in its current specification, and examining the endogenous
 factors that explain these developments will be a topic of further 
study.</p>

<p>This paper has presented documentation for the large-scale estimated 
EDO model of the U.S. economy used for projections and policy analysis 
at the Federal Reserve Board. Cyclical dynamics are mostly accounted for
 by shocks to risk premia (e.g., see the discussion of output gaps in 
Kiley
(2010b)). The integration of business cycle and growth facts in a 
two-sector model with investment-specific technological progress also 
allows consideration of key drivers of productivity and long-run growth.
 Ongoing research examines a range of issues related to the sources of 
economic
fluctuations, financial frictions, and the design of monetary and fiscal
 policy (e.g., at the zero lower bound).</p>
